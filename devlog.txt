Ok so the flow i am thinking is like,


From the list of products we click 'Manage variants' buttons for a product.
It will render a layout .This layout has tab at top which has [Variants] [Generate Variants]

When we click 'Variants' tab it will render 'ManageVariantsPage'
and when we click 'Generate Variants' tab it will render 'GenerateVariantsPage'


'GenerateVariantsPage'.This page lets us Generate new variants for the product. This page basically has below sections,
1.ProductDetailsCard section -> Shows the details of the product for which we are Generating the variants
2.AttributesManagement section -> shows all the attributes and for each attribute the options.
3.VariantImageManagement section -> if we have select the color attribute the this section is show. It will lets us select the images for each color. This images will be linked to the variants whos has matching color
4.VariantsTable section -> it will show the auto generated variants(different combinations based on what attributes and options are selected).
5.EditVariantDetailsForm section -> It we click the edit button of the auto generated variant item in table then this form gets open. It will show the price,sku,name of variant,Active status:true or false and images which are linked to variant color which are not editable on the variant level 


'ManageVariantsPage'. This page lets us edit the already exisiting variants in db.This page basically has sections,
1.ProductDetailsCard section -> shows the details of the product
2.VariantImageManagement section -> shows the color attributes options and we can delete or  add new images for the color.   
2.VariantsTable section -> All the Variants list in table
3.EditVariantDetailsForm section -> When we click the edit button for a variant in table then this form will get populated with the variants details. we can edit name,stock,status. This form will also show the link images which are readonly and can be edited only from VariantImageManagement section.




GenerateVariantsPage & ManageVariantsPage both are rendered in nextjs page.tsx which are server component.
ManageVariantsPage is basically the edit page which lets us edit the variants details etc..
GenerateVariantsPage is basically for creating new variants for the product.

What data ManageVariantsPage/GenerateVariantsPage will need?
1. They will require Products details
2. They will also require product's all variants(ManageVariantsPage only)
3. They will also require all the attributes and options. But for ManageVariantsPage it will also require the
   attributes and options for which the variants are generated. 




Flow, (for generating the new variants)
Admin/Store manager clicks the 'Manage Variants button for a product'.
It will render a layout which has tabs at top. Admin/Store manager will select 'Generate Variants' tab.

GenerateVariantsPage opens.
It will show products details,
All the products attributes and options.

Admin/Store manager selects the options.A attribute is considered selected if at least one options is selected.
If there is Color attribute and we admin selects any one color we also show 'VariantImageManagement' component.
'VariantImageManagement' will show the colors selected as tabs. So if the admin has selected 'Red', 'Green'
and 'Blue' color then VariantImageManagement will show this colors as tabs. If we select any color tab
it opens a image selection input which lets us select multiple image for the color. 
So for each color options we can select images. If admin unselects the any color option in AttributesManagement
then that color tab will also disappears from the VariantImageManagement color tabs.

At this point the admin has selected the attribute options and for color attribute he has selected images.

He the clicks the 'Generate variants' button. This will generate all the combinations(variants) and will be rendered in 
a table 'VariantsTable'. Each table item has edit button.  Clicking the edit button opens 'EditVariantDetailsForm'.
As we are at 'GenerateVariantsPage' this EditVariantDetailsForm will only show the sku of variant at top.
Price will be the base price of the product, stock,name,status will be default. admin will change the values.
This 'EditVariantDetailsForm' will also show the images for the variant color. This image however are readonly.

Now there is a button 'Save Variant'. When the admin clicks this button then the variant is saved(not in db but in component state only).
So admin can change the values for each variant and save them individually. 

Now at the end we have 'Save Variants' button. Clicking on this we will Save all the variants to the db. Upload images to cloudinary etc, etc stuff.




Flow(for editing the exisiting variants of a product).
Admin/Store manager clicks the 'Manage Variants button for a product'.
It will render a layout which has tabs at top. Admin/Store manager will select 'Variants' tab.

ManageVariantsPage opens.
It will show products details,
All the exisiting variants of the product in a table 'VariantsTable'.
Admin click the eidt button of a particular variant. This will open 'EditVariantDetailsForm'.
It will get populated with all the variants details. Admin can edit all the details, excepts the images. They are still
readonly. If admin want to change the image he can do it from the 'VariantImageManagement'.
'VariantImageManagement' will show the Color options which are associated with the exisiting variants.
Admin can edit image for each color.
Similar to the 'GenerateVariantsPage' each variant will be edited and saved to component state.

At last when the admin clicks the 'Save Variants' then we make changes to db.



Key difference b/w 'GenerateVariantsPage' and 'ManageVariantsPage'.

In 'GenerateVariantsPage' we can toggle the attribute options.
In 'ManageVariantsPage' attributes and their options are just readable and all the associated options will be pre-selected. We can toggle them.

In 'GenerateVariantsPage',  VariantImageManagement will show the color options which admin has toggle in 'AttributesManagement'.
In 'ManageVariantsPage', we will show the color options associated with all the exisiting variants.

Special case.
If a product has exisiting variants and admin decides to Generate new variants.
The flow will be same for GenerateVariantsPage, but once we generate we will check if the variants allready exists
in the  exisiting variants, then we higlight the variants which are duplicate in VariantsTable. Until the user removes the
duplicate ones we wont let the 'Save Variants' button to work.


Now go throught the above everything and tell me you understand it or not. Explain me in very short and crisp what u understand.







lets start with GenerateVariantsPage logic.
We have productId,
We will need, 
product details for productId,
exisitingVariants,
all attributes with options,

/api/admin/products/[productId]variants-data



i have implemented the toggle function

  const [attributes, setAttributes] = useState<Attribute[]>([]);

    const toggleAttributeOption = (attributeId: number, optionId: number) => {
        setAttributes((prevAttributes) =>
        prevAttributes.map((attribute) => {
            if (attribute.id === attributeId) {
            return {
                ...attribute,
                options: attribute.options.map((option) =>
                option.id === optionId
                    ? { ...option, selected: !option.selected }
                    : option
                ),
            };
            }
            return attribute;
        })
        );
    };


Now i want that if color options is selected that that color options will be shown as tabs and for each tab we can select the images. Now since i am left with only question that i can ask to you, i want that in that on response you gave me all the logic i need.


So as of now we can toggle the attribute options.
I want that if the color options are selected then we want to show them as tabs. This tabs lets us
select images for each color. 
So i want to render the selected color options as tabs. 
So we need a useState to add the color options.

Also we need to upload the image which are linked to color option(optionId,attributeId,productId).
So when we select a color options from the tab we show its images we can delete the images add new one 
Now we need to maintain the actual  File data and image preview url also so that images can be preview.

now i have a div which has plus icon. I have a hidden input which lets admin select mulitple image for that color.
There is a container which will show the preview of the selected images. Each image has remove buttons
which will let us remove that image. We can do this for all color option.

We will also have a fileInputRef. When we click on div the input will be fire to take images input.
When we select the images they will be map to that color. 
Also when we generate the variants we want to show the images for that variant's  color.

Now lets not focus on ui, but focus on image selection, removing, options color tabs,
image preivews. You can take assume some dummy ui in your response.
